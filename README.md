# Purpose

This repository has the work for my master thesis, which involves using [WGCNA](https://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/).

Each branch is intended to use for a different kind of projects:

 * microarrays
   For analysing gene expression either by microarrays or sequencing.
 * miRNA
   For analysing microRNA data from sequencing.
 * master
   For general things common to both workflows.
